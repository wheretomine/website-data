{"name":"Aquachain","abbreviation":"AQUA","slug":"aquachain","description":"A distributed financial computing platform, secured by proof of work. It is a cryptocurrency, with smart contracts, capable of rapid change in protocol. Changes can be to keep up with technology, or make changes to the consensus rules to add features. Without a pre-mine, pre-sale, ICO, or dev funds, Aquachain was created as a more experimental, slower, fair launch alternative to other smart contract platforms.","lastUpdated":"2019-08-05T17:59:00.489Z","subPools":[{"paymentInformation":{"paymentThreshold":{"min":0.01,"max":314},"fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":0,"max":314},"infoUrl":"","paymentScheme":"PROP"},"isAlive":false,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-06T15:34:51.162Z","url":"https://aquacha.in/pool","slug":"4124","poolProfile":{"name":"AquaCha.in","slug":"aquacha-in"}},{"paymentInformation":{"paymentThreshold":{"min":0.1,"max":314},"fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":0.1,"max":314},"infoUrl":"","paymentScheme":"PROP"},"isAlive":true,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-06T15:34:51.162Z","url":"https://aqua.signal2noi.se","slug":"4125","poolProfile":{"name":"Signal2Noi.se","slug":"signal2noi-se"}},{"paymentInformation":{"paymentThreshold":{"min":0.1,"max":314},"fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":0.5,"max":314},"infoUrl":"","paymentScheme":"PROP"},"isAlive":true,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-06T15:34:51.162Z","url":"https://aquapool.rplant.xyz","slug":"4127","poolProfile":{"name":"RPlant.xyz","slug":"rplant-xyz"}},{"paymentInformation":{"infoUrl":"http://aqua.hashpool.eu","paymentThreshold":{"min":0.1,"max":314},"paymentScheme":"PROP","fee":{"feeType":"Fixed","min":0.5,"max":314},"paymentInterval":1800},"isAlive":true,"lastUpdated":"2019-08-12T08:30:55.089Z","url":"http://aqua.hashpool.eu","slug":"4126","poolProfile":{"name":"HashPool.eu","slug":"hashpool-eu"}}],"numberOfSubPools":4,"links":[{"name":"Website","platform":"website","url":"https://aquachain.github.io/"},{"name":"Explorer","platform":"explorer","url":"https://aquachain.github.io/explorer/"},{"name":"Explorer","platform":"explorer","url":"https://explorer.aqua.signal2noi.se/home"},{"name":"Reddit","platform":"reddit","url":"https://reddit.com/r/Aquachain"},{"name":"Twitter","platform":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/aquacrypto"},{"name":"Telegram","platform":"telegram","url":"https://t.me/aquacrypto"},{"name":"Discord","platform":"discord","url":"https://discordapp.com/invite/55a3tu9"},{"name":"BitcoinTalk","platform":"bitcointalk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3138231.0"},{"name":"GitHub","platform":"github","url":"https://github.com/aquanetwork"}],"algorithm":{"name":"Argon2id","type":"ARGON2ID_ALGORITHM","slug":"argon2id"},"coinCap":{"isAvailable":false,"id":"noid"}}
