{"name":"Argon2i","type":"ARGON2I_ALGORITHM","slug":"argon2i","description":"Argon2i is a variant of the Argon2 cryptographic hashing algorithm. Argon2 is a key derivation function that was selected as the winner of the Password Hashing Competition in July 2015. Argon2d maximizes resistance to GPU cracking attacks. It accesses the memory array in a password dependent order, which reduces the possibility of time memory trade-off aka (TMTO) attacks, but introduces possible side-channel attacks.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[{"name":"Info","platform":"info","url":"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48062/argon2i-versus-argon2d"}],"coins":[{"numberOfSubPools":8,"name":"Arionum","abbreviation":"ARO","slug":"arionum"},{"numberOfSubPools":1,"name":"Globaltoken (Argon2i)","abbreviation":"GLT","slug":"globaltoken-argon2i"}]}
