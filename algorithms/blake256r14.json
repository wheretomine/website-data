{"name":"Blake256R14","type":"BLAKE256R14_ALGORITHM","slug":"blake256r14","description":"BLAKE and BLAKE2 are cryptographic hash functions based on Dan Bernstein&amp;#x27;s ChaCha stream cipher, but a permuted copy of the input block, XORed with some round constants, is added before each ChaCha round. Like SHA-2, there are two variants differing in the word size. BLAKE-256 and BLAKE-224 use 32-bit words and produce digest sizes of 256 bits and 224 bits, respectively, while BLAKE-512 and BLAKE-384 use 64-bit words and produce digest sizes of 512 bits and 384 bits, respectively.","defaults":{"userHashrate":0,"powerConsumption":0},"links":[{"name":"Info","platform":"info","url":"https://blake2.net/"}],"coins":[{"numberOfSubPools":18,"name":"Decred","abbreviation":"DCR","slug":"decred"}]}
